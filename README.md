### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
The website analyzes waste type, quantity, and risk factors, helping authorities monitor limits and charge extra for excess waste. It also classifies materials like plastic and metal to improve recycling efficiency and environmental safety. 

### The Problem statement
Many communities struggle with improper waste disposal, lack of monitoring, and poor segregation of garbage, leading to environmental pollution and health risks. There is no efficient system to track household waste generation or ensure accountability. This creates a need for a smart solution that monitors, manages, and encourages responsible waste disposal.
### The Solution
create a website for analyse the proper disposal of waste
